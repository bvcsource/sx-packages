Description: Scalable public and private cloud storage
 Skylable Sx is a reliable, fully distributed cluster solution for your data
 storage needs.

 merge it into a single storage system.
 The cluster makes sure that your data is always replicated over multiple nodes
 (the exact number of copies is defined by the sysadmin) and synchronized.
 .
 Additionally Sx has built-in support for deduplication, client-side
 encryption, on-the-fly compression and much more.
